## Hi there, my name is Sophia, but you can just call me Soap. ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I'm a graphic designer looking to transition into being a 3D artist and indie game developer. My goal is to have all the skills necessary to be a one-man studio by the time I'm 40.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on looking for part time graphic design jobs, and one-time projects because I need money.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 3D on blender.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about graphic design.
